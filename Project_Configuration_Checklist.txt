Here is a checklist outlining the necessary steps for the successful functioning of the project:

AWS:

1. Create an IAM user named "S3UploaderBot".
2. Assign an inline policy to the IAM user that grants access to upload objects to the designated S3 bucket.
3. Configure the bucket policy for the target bucket to enable S3UploaderBot to upload files into it.

GitHub Actions - Secrets and Variables:

1. Store the AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key of the automation user as repository secrets, using the names "S3FILEUPLOADERBOT_AWS_AK" and "S3FILEUPLOADERBOT_AWS_SAK" respectively.
2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with read and write permissions for the GitHub Repository. Then, add this PAT token as a repository secret and label it as "GH_TOKEN".
